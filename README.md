If you like one of the artworks and want to buy them, all you need 
to do is click the buy button. Soon you will be redirected to the payment page
where you'll be asked for your payment information.

```
But sometimes, you might need more than a single art. Well you're in luck;
instead of buying each art one by one, you can add them to your cart and
buy them all at once.

To access or view your cart item, you can access your cart in the navigation bar.
```

Let's say you can't find an art that piques your interest, we got you covered then too.
We have a "Generate your own art" section for people with exquisite taste.

To access it, you can either find it at the navigation bar or the bottom of the home page
and click the `Generate` button.
```

Once you're redirected to art generation page, you can type your prompt
for the art you want then press the `Generate Image` button; 
after a while, your own custom artwork will appear as shown below. Since the size of the generated images are large in size, we recommend you to be patient while it loads, also to maintain a stable internet connection while loading the image.

## Lessons Learned

Through the development of this project, we gained a profound appreciation for the transformative capabilities of JavaScript and CSS in shaping a webpage. Here are some key insights and skills we acquired:

- Dynamic Styling with CSS: We explored a wide array of CSS styling techniques, discovering how they can dramatically enhance the visual appeal and user experience of a webpage. From responsive design to advanced animations, CSS proved to be a powerful tool for creating engaging and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.

- JavaScript for Interactivity: We delved into JavaScriptâ€™s ability to add dynamic functionality to our project. Learning how to call APIs, manipulate the DOM, and handle user events enabled us to create a more interactive and responsive application. This included dynamically adding and updating elements based on user interactions or external data.

- API Integration: We mastered the process of making API calls using JavaScript, which allowed us to fetch and display data from external sources. This integration was crucial for incorporating real-time information and enhancing the functionality of our project.

- Element Manipulation: Through JavaScript, we learned how to programmatically add, modify, and remove elements from the DOM. This skill is essential for creating dynamic content and ensuring that our webpage responds efficiently to user inputs and data changes.

Overall, these experiences have deepened our understanding of web development and showcased the immense potential of combining JavaScript and CSS to build sophisticated, user-friendly applications. We hope you will enjoy our exploring our project as much as we enjoyed making it.
